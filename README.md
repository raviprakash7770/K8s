# k8s - Kubernetes version 1.5.2 stable in CentOS 7
mkdir ~/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roybhaskar9/k8s/master/Vagrantfile
vagrant up
# Now start master server installation
vagrant ssh master
# Inside Master Server
sudo su -
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roybhaskar9/k8s/master/MasterInstall
chmod +x MasterInstall
./MasterInstall
# Then follow instructions on MasterConfig file in this repository
# After configuring Master run the below command
kubectl get nodes
# Now launch 3 more terminal windows apart from Master server terminal
# Terminal 1 
vagrant ssh minion1
sudo su -
# Then follow instructions as per Minion1Config file in this repository
# Terminal 2 
vagrant ssh minion2
sudo su -
# Then follow instructions as per Minion2Config file in this repository
# Terminal 3 
vagrant ssh minion3
sudo su -
# Then follow instructions as per Minion3Config file in this repository

# After setting up Minions, come back to Master Server and run below command
kubectl get nodes

# Now the output show 192.168.33.20, 192.168.33.30 and 192.168.33.40 nodes as ready

# Launch first app
# On Master Server
kubectl run my-nginx --image=nginx
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods -o wide

# Gather the ip of newly launched pod once it is ready. Also notice the ip of node
# Go to the node with that ip. 192.168.33.20 => Minion1, 192.168.33.30 => Minion2, 192.168.33.40 => Minion3
# On that particular minion server, if the ip of pod is lets say 172.17.0.2, then run below command

yum install -y lynx
lynx 172.17.0.2

# This should show a nginx sample web page
